# Changelog

## 0.10.0
## New Features
* Whole bunch of new options when launching a launch file:
    * The `stopAll` option now allows to stop all other debug sessions when any of them is stopped.
    * The `stopCoreAfterDebug` allow to stop the core when the last debug session is stopped, if it was started automatically when the debug session was launched.
    * The `stopLaunchedNodes` option will now automatically stop all launched-only nodes when the last associated debug session is closed.
    * The `attachTerminalsToProcesses` option will now automatically attach the launched-only nodes to terminals.
        * The `terminateOnTerminalClosed` option will now automatically terminate the launched-only nodes when the associated terminal is closed.
* When launching a launch file, the `launch` and `attachDebugger` options now allow to filter by node name and node namespace, in addition to node executable as before.

## 0.9.3
zero change release to prime the pre-release channel for future test releases.

## 0.9.2
Hot fix for ROS1 Debugging

## 0.9.1
* Revert change to filter XML and YAML files from launching.

## 0.9.0
## Thank you!
This extension has crossed an impressive milestone - 500,000 Installs! 

## New Features
* Includes the ability to debug ROS2 launch files using the new debug_launch type. 
> Notes:
    This only debugs the launch file itself - it does not launch any ROS nodes. 
    If your launch file does execute code, these may launch during debugging. 

* Smaller runtime, Faster Startup using WebPack
* `.urdf` files are now processed with `xacro`
* Fixes to ROS2 in a container
